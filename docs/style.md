# Presto style guidelines

Focus always on the library's purpose: simple, reliable, and predictable APIs.

1. Ensure code is clear and tidy.
2. Use available PHP language features to the best of their ability and purpose.
3. Prefer capable PHP built-ins and libraries.
4. Design needs to discover and embody the relevant concepts truthfully (and no more). Look for aspects of a design that violate the underlying purpose.
5. Good code always includes usage documentation, inline strategic notes, and unit tests in addition to the code itself.
